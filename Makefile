# Disable multi threading. This will make the program smaller and a tiny
# bit easier on the system. It will make it slower in real time though,

#NO_THREADS = 1

# Disable support for long options. Will make the program smaller
# and perhaps even more portable.
#NO_LONG_OPTIONS = 1

# Disable a redundent check to see if the amount of bytes read from files
# when calculating their hash strings matches the sum of reported file sizes.
# I've never seen this fail. It will fail if you start deleting or altering
# files yet to be hashed while mktorrent is running, but who'd want to do that?

# Set the number of micro seconds mktorrent will wait between every progress
# report when hashing multi threaded. Default is 200000 that is 0.2 seconds
# between every update.
#PROGRESS_PERIOD = 200000

# Maximum number of file descriptors mktorrent will open when scanning the
# directory. Default is 100, but I have no idea what a sane default
# for this value is, so your number is probably better ;)
